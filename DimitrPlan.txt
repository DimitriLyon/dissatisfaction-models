Make sure the .txt files have the diss annotations.

Second modify the tracklist files to hold the proper references.

New problem: Have to modify labelToFloat.m so that it accepts the labels from the fireboy corpus. 
OR I can modify the annotations to make them compatible with the code.  Will have to talk with Jonathon.

Third, modify the code that trains the model to deal with two tracks of data.
Or, duplicate files and give them l or r names.  so I only need to output annotations from one track.
Think I'm going with this.
